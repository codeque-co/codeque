# What is CodeQue?

CodeQue is semantic code search engine that understands the code syntax. 

It matches code structurally which makes it excellent for more complex queries.

Query language offers wildcards, partial matching and ignores code formatting. 

Structural code search is available for JavaScript, TypesScript, HTML, CSS and more soon.

Text code search with handy wildcards is available for __every language__ and covers common regex search use cases.
