# What is CodeQue?

CodeQue is semantic code search engine that understands the code syntax. 

It matches code structurally which makes it excellent for more complex queries.

Query language offers wildcards, partial matching and ignores code formatting. 

Structural code search is available for JavaScript, TypesScript, HTML, CSS and more soon.

Text code search with handy wildcards is available for __every language__ and covers common regex search use cases.

 playground</b></a></p>

<p align="center"><i>Just paste code snippet to start searching, no installation needed!</i></p>

__Integrations__

CodeQue is available as:

- [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeQue.codeque) for delightful code search and navigation experience.
- [ESLint integration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codeque/eslint-plugin) for creating custom linting rules in zero time.
- [CLI tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codeque/cli) for searching code and more including headless environments.

<p align="center"><i>All CodeQue tools <b>operate offline</b> hence code never leaves your local environment.</i></p>

## ESLint integration üíÖ

Using CodeQue ESLint plugin you can create your own custom linting rules in zero time.

Custom ESLint rules can help execute on long-term refactors or prevent introducing codebase specific bugs or bad patterns.

Rules can replace your decision log and help standardizing coding conventions across the project or organization.

CodeQue ESLint integration is a no-brainier for any team willing to improve their codebase quality.

<!-- ESLINT INTRO END -->

## Installation

```sh
yarn add --dev @codeque/eslint-plugin
```

CodeQue supports all parsers officially supported by ESLint
- [Espree](https://github.com/eslint/espree)
- [Esprima](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esprima)
- [@babel/eslint-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/eslint-parser)
- [@typescript-eslint/parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/parser)

üëâ Open GitHub issue to [request parser support](https://github.com/codeque-co/codeque/issues)

## Configuration

Add `@codeque` plugin to plugins list in your `.eslintrc`.

And then add a definition for one of the rules: 
- `@codeque/error`
- `@codeque/warning`

There are two rules, so you can configure them to report errors or warnings.

Each rule should be provided with a list of rule config objects with CodeQue queries.

Learn more about writing queries from [CodeQue docs](https://codeque.co/docs)

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@codeque"],
  "rules": {
    "@codeque/error": ["error", [
      {
        "query": "fetchData()",
        "mode": "exact",
        "message": "Using fetchData() without parameters causes app crash!",
      },
    ]],
    "@codeque/warning": ["warn", [
      {
        "query": "import $$$ from 'lodash';",
        "mode": "include",
        "message": "Prefer to import lodash functions from separate packages like 'lodash.debounce'",
      },
    ]]
  }
}
```

The above configuration
- rises an error when `fetchData()` function is called without parameters
- reports a warning when utility is imported from main `lodash` package

</p>


> If your config seems too big, feel free to extract your set of rules to a separate file. Change your `.eslintrc` to JS file and import rules from a separate file.

## Rule config object properties

Minimal rule config object should contain just `query` key

```js
({
  query: "someCode"
})
```

The default settings are:
- `mode` - `include`
- `message` - `Restricted code pattern`
- `caseInsensitive` - `true`
- `includeFiles` - `undefined` (do not filter files provided by ESLint)
- `excludeFiles` - `[]` (do not filter files provided by ESLint)

All configuration options

```ts
type RuleConfig = {
  query: string // Content of the query
  mode: 'exact' | 'include' | 'include-with-order' // CodeQue search mode
  message: string // Error message to display 
  caseInsensitive: boolean // Whether query should perform matches case insensitively
  includeFiles: string[] | undefined // list of glob patterns to indicate files against which given rule should be executed
  excludeFiles: string[] // list of glob patterns to indicate files against which given rule should not be executed
}
```

## Rule examples

CodeQue is general purpose code search tool. The examples list could be endless. Here are some of them for you to get a glimpse of what's possible. Those are relatively simple, you will definitely  find some more complex during day to day work.

### All usages of `console` object

Searching for console logs, warnings, errors is quite simple use-case and can be achieved using traditional tools, but It's for you to warm up üòÅ

This rule warns about all places in the code that can output some (usually unwanted) logs.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "@codeque/warning": ["warn", [
      {
        "query": "console.$$()",
        "mode": "include",
        "message": "Prefer to use 'Logger' util.",
      },
    ]]
  }
}
```

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/codeque-co/codeque/blob/master/packages/eslint/readme-media/console-log.gif?raw=true" />
</p>

### Library specific issues

Third party code not always work as expected. Whenever you spot a problem, add custom eslint rule to spread that knowledge across your team.

The rule warns against using `disabled` property on `SomeLibComponent`, and suggest using not documented `isDisabled` prop instead.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "@codeque/warning": ["warn", [
      {
        "query": "<SomeLibComponent disabled />",
        "mode": "include",
        "message": "'disabled' property does not work as expected. Use 'isDisabled' instead",
        "includeFiles": ["**/*.tsx"]
      },
    ]]
  }
}
```

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/codeque-co/codeque/blob/master/packages/eslint/readme-media/disabled-prop.gif?raw=true" />
</p>

### Unstable hook reference

Some 3rd party hooks are not implemented correctly and return non-memoized variables.

In this rule we rise an error when `confirm` callback from `useAsyncDialog` is used as an item of `useCallback` dependency array.

This is interesting example that links together two statements in the same code block, that does not necessarily have to directly follow each other.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "@codeque/error": ["error", [
      {
        "query": "const { confirm } = useAsyncDialog(); const $$ = useCallback($$$, [confirm]);",
        "mode": "include",
        "message": "'confirm' is known to be unstable. Using it in hook dependency array can cause render loop",
      },
    ]]
  }
}
```

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/codeque-co/codeque/blob/master/packages/eslint/readme-media/unstable-hook.gif?raw=true" />
</p>

### React bad patterns

First rule restricts usage of object literal as a prop. Object literal could be extracted to variable in upper scope or memoized to avoid performance issues.

Second rule restricts places where a given array is mapped directly in JSX. It could be memoized to make the array reference stable and reduce re-renders.


```json
{
  "rules": {
    "@codeque/error": ["error", [
      {
        "query": "<$$ $$={{}} />",
        "mode": "include",
        "message": "Don't use object literal in JSX props",
        "includeFiles": ["**/*.tsx"]
      },
      {
        "query": "<$$ $$={$$$.map(() => ($$$))} />",
        "mode": "include",
        "message": "'disabled' property does not work as expected. Use 'isDisabled' instead",
        "includeFiles": ["**/*.tsx"]
      },
    ]]
  }
}
```

</p>

## Debugging performance

You can check performance of your CodeQue ESLint rules by running

```sh
TIMING=ALL CODEQUE_DEBUG=true yarn YOUR_LINT_SCRIPT
```

Very generic rules or those containing wildcards on top level might be slow.

Remember to be specific if possible and use file filtering options eg. to not run  JSX rules on `*.js` files.

## Telemetry

Plugin collects completely anonymous telemetry that helps me get insights about usage.

It's implemented using `applicationinsights` and you can easily opt-out.
